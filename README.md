SNAKE GAME IN C++
Overview
This is a console-based Snake game implemented in C++ using basic libraries such as <iostream>, <conio.h>, <cstdlib>, and <windows.h>. The game features simple mechanics where the player controls the snake to eat food while avoiding walls and itself. The snake grows longer as it eats food, and the game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
